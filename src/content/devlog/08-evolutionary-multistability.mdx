title: "Experiment 08: The Evolutionary Landscape Fractures Under Noise"
date: 2026-02-28
description: "E-007 showed TF2T leads the round-robin at ε=0.01–0.05. Does this translate to evolutionary dominance? No. The replicator dynamics reveal something more interesting: noise fractures the unique cooperative equilibrium into a multistable landscape of competing attractors. At ε=0, TF2T wins 68% of seeds. At ε=0.01, six different strategies each win 8–25% of seeds. Pavlov — ranked 4th–6th in round-robin — emerges as a major evolutionary attractor under noise, winning 25–35% of seeds at ε=0.01 and ε=0.02."

## Research Question

E-007 established that TF2T outranks every strategy in round-robin at ε=0.01–0.05.
The canonical expectation is that round-robin performance predicts evolutionary success.
**Does TF2T's noise-robust cooperation translate to evolutionary dominance under noise?**

## Results

### Attractor Frequencies (40 seeds, 200 generations, 12 strategies)

The key measure: across 40 independent seeds (each giving a slightly different payoff
matrix due to noise), which strategy reaches evolutionary dominance?

### Finding 1: TF2T's round-robin advantage does not predict evolutionary dominance

At ε=0, TF2T wins 27 of 40 seeds (68%) — it is the dominant evolutionary attractor
in clean conditions. But under any noise:

- **ε=0.01**: TF2T wins only 25% of seeds — tied with Pavlov, while Gradual (23%)
  and GenTFT (18%) are competitive
- **ε=0.02**: TF2T wins only 18% of seeds, behind GenTFT (38%) and Pavlov (35%)
- **ε=0.05**: TF2T wins 20% of seeds — one of 9 different winners

The unique stable equilibrium of ε=0 (TF2T dominant) shatters as soon as noise is
introduced. Cooperation survives in most trajectories — but no single cooperative
strategy is the stable attractor.

### Finding 2: The evolutionary landscape is multistable under noise

At ε=0, there is essentially one basin of attraction for the cooperative equilibrium.
At ε>0, multiple stable equilibria coexist, and which one is reached depends on the
specific pairwise payoff matrix (seed):

| ε | Number of distinct winners (across 40 seeds) |
|---|----------------------------------------------|
| 0 | 3 (TF2T, Gradual, GenTFT) |
| 0.01 | 6 |
| 0.02 | 5 |
| 0.05 | 9 |

The ε=0 result shows limited variation (only 3 distinct winners, strongly concentrated
on TF2T). At ε=0.05, 9 different strategies each win in at least one seed.

**Why?** The mean-field replicator dynamics use a payoff matrix derived from a single
round-robin tournament. At ε>0, the tournament payoffs have noise-induced variance —
different seeds produce slightly different payoff matrices. Near the boundaries between
basins of attraction, small perturbations in the payoff matrix tip the dynamics toward
different equilibria. Noise doesn't just change which equilibrium is preferred — it
creates *multiple* stable equilibria where previously there was only one.

### Finding 3: Pavlov is a major evolutionary attractor under noise

Pavlov (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift) ranks 4th–7th in round-robin across all noise levels.
Yet it is one of the most frequent evolutionary winners:

- ε=0.01: wins 25% of seeds (tied for most)
- ε=0.02: wins 35% of seeds (second most frequent, behind GenTFT 38%)
- ε=0.05: wins 25% of seeds (tied for most)

**The mechanism:** Pavlov's Win-Stay/Lose-Shift rule gives it a unique noise-recovery
property when facing another Pavlov. If a noise event forces mutual defection (both
lose), both partners shift to cooperation immediately — a single round of mutual
defection triggers recovery. This makes Pavlov vs Pavlov resilient to noise events.

But this only explains self-play. The deeper reason Pavlov wins evolutionarily is that
it forms a stable fixed point that is hard to invade. Once Pavlov dominates a
population, other cooperative strategies find it difficult to spread because Pavlov
exploits slight defectors (Win-Stay when collecting T) and recovers from noise.

In contrast, TF2T is exploitable once it dominates: its leniency (requiring two
consecutive defections to retaliate) allows ZD Extorter and Random to score above
their cost ratio against it.

          </td>
        ))}
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

*ε=0, seed=42: Stable cooperative equilibrium — 8 strategies coexist, AllD extinct by gen 25.*

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Gen</th>
      {trackedData[1].series.map(s => <th key={s.name}>{s.name.replace("Tit for Two Tats","TF2T").replace("Generous TFT","GenTFT").replace("Always Defect","AllD")}</th>)}
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {trackedData[1].gens.map((g, gi) => (
      <tr key={g}>
        <td><strong>G{g}</strong></td>
        {trackedData[1].series.map(s => (
          <td key={s.name} style={`color: ${s.shares[gi] > 50 ? "var(--green)" : s.shares[gi] < 1 ? "var(--muted)" : "var(--text)"}`}>
            {s.shares[gi] > 0.05 ? s.shares[gi].toFixed(1)+"%" : "—"}
          </td>
        ))}
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

*ε=0.01, seed=42: Pavlov rises from 8.3% to dominate at 92.5%. TF2T goes extinct by gen 50; AllD goes extinct early.*

## The Disconnect: Round-Robin vs. Evolutionary Fitness

The gap between round-robin rank and evolutionary win-rate is stark:

| Strategy | Round-robin rank at ε=0.01 | Evolutionary win-rate at ε=0.01 |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Tit for Two Tats | **2.10** (1st) | 25% (tied 1st) |
| Generous TFT | 2.57 (2nd) | 18% |
| Pavlov | 4.62 (5th) | **25% (tied 1st)** |
| Gradual | 3.20 (3rd) | 23% |
| Contrite TFT | 4.81 (4th) | 8% |

Pavlov is 5th in round-robin but tied for most frequent evolutionary winner. The reason
lies in what round-robin measures vs what replicator dynamics select for:

**Round-robin** measures mean score against a fixed, diverse field. TF2T scores well
because it cooperates effectively with many partners while deflecting most exploitation.

**Replicator dynamics** select for strategies that grow when rare (invasion fitness)
*and* cannot be invaded when common (fixation stability). Pavlov has superior
fixation stability — a population of Pavlovs is hard to invade — even though it
scores lower in a mixed field.

This echoes Axelrod's own observation: TFT won his tournament but does not dominate
the evolutionary dynamics — other strategies can form closed, uninvadable populations.

---

## Summary

The central question — does TF2T's round-robin advantage translate to evolutionary
dominance under noise? — has a clear answer: **no**.

Noise fractures the evolutionary landscape. The unique cooperative attractor of the
clean game (dominated by TF2T) becomes a collection of competing basins. Under any
positive noise:

1. **Multistability:** Multiple stable equilibria coexist. Small differences in the
   payoff matrix (due to noise) determine which equilibrium the dynamics reach.

2. **Pavlov as a major attractor:** Despite ranking 4th–7th in round-robin, Pavlov
   wins 25–35% of evolutionary trajectories under noise. Its fixation stability
   (hard to invade once common) outweighs its mediocre mixed-field score.

3. **Survival of cooperation:** Across all noise levels tested, defection strategies
   (AllD, ZD, Random) win at most 12% of trajectories. Cooperation is robust
   in aggregate, even if which cooperative strategy wins is unpredictable.

---

## Next Steps

**E-009: Pavlov's fixation stability.** Pavlov's evolutionary success comes from
being difficult to invade, not from round-robin score. The specific question: starting
from a Pavlov-dominated population (90%+ Pavlov), which strategies can successfully
invade, and at what noise level does invasion succeed? This measures *basin of
attraction size* rather than single-seed outcomes.
